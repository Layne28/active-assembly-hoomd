Perform simulations of particles in an active noise field.
The "scripts" folder contains the scripts needed to run simulations.

-- initialize.py: Create initial configurations (lattice)
-- randomize.py: Create a random initial configuration by running hard sphere dynamics
-- run.py: Run dynamics in an active noise field

The other "run_[stuff].py" scripts run different systems (single particles and networks).
